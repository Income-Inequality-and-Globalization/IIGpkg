\usage{
data_plot_processing(
  out_measures,
  out_regs,
  pth_data,
  vars_to_use,
  names_measures,
  settings
)
}
\arguments{
\item{out_measures}{A three-dimensional array of estimated measure-coefficient values.
The dimensions are expected to correspond to entities (e.g., countries),
time periods, and measure statistics (mean, lower confidence band, upper
confidence band). This data is used to append new variables to the dataset.}

\item{out_regs}{An optional data frame or matrix containing regression data
to be merged with the measure data. Each row should correspond to an
observation, and columns should include the regression variables of interest.
If NULL, no regression data is merged.}

\item{pth_data}{Path to the CSV data file containing the raw data set. The
file is read into R and processed according to the specified parameters.}

\item{vars_to_use}{A vector of variable names from the raw data set that should
be retained for analysis and plotting. This allows for the inclusion of
specific variables of interest beyond the generated measure variables.}

\item{names_measures}{A named list or vector specifying the column names to
be created in the dataset for each type of measure (mean, lower confidence
band, upper confidence band). These names are dynamically used to assign
measure values to the appropriate columns in the processed dataset.}

\item{settings}{A list of settings for data processing, including:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{scale_measure}:}{ A numeric value used to scale the measure
  values. Defaults to 1 if not specified, indicating no scaling. This is
  applied uniformly to mean, lower, and upper confidence band values.}
  \item{\code{x_var}:}{ The name of the variable used for regression data
  merging and/or plotting. This should correspond to a variable in both the
  raw data and the regression data (if provided).}
  \item Other settings as required for processing, such as transformation
  flags or additional variable names to include.
}}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the processed data. This includes the original
  variables specified by `vars_to_use`, new measure variables as named by
  `names_measures`, and optionally merged regression data. Variables not
  specified for retention or addition are omitted from the returned tibble.
}
\description{
This function reads data from a specified path, preprocesses it by scaling
measure-coefficient values, and optionally merges it with regression data.
The processed data is then ready for plotting or further analysis. This
includes scaling the measure values, merging additional regression data, and
selecting relevant variables for visualization.
